# AOA_Standalone

This is a standalone self-contained angle of attack indicator designed to be used in an experimental aircraft.

The indicator requires pitot tube that contains an additional port tilted 60 degrees off the main pitot port axis. The concept is very similar to the Dynon units. So Dynon’s AoA pitot tube can be used for this indicator.
Another good option is a blade type pitot that is very common on Piper Cherokees. It requires a small modification - the hole at the back of the blade should be closed.

The unit is in the testing phase.
Your comments and contributions are highly appreciated.
